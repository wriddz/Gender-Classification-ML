Nowadays gender classification is a very challenging task in a real-time application based on face recognition. The demand for real-time application based on gender classification will increase in the future. Human Gender classification is one of the most interested and critical area of research. Research contains interactions between computers and human which includes vast information concerning difference in characteristics of males and females. In several kind of pattern recognition, machine learning gives a relation between gender and face. This paper proposes comparison between different techniques used for gender classification. Face is a unique biometric feature of the individual. Gender Classification using CNN(Convolution Neural Network), Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV.
